# Purpose-and-Scope
The purpose of this ontology is to formalize semantic relationships such as student enrollments, faculty teaching assignments, and course prerequisite structures to enable automated academic reasoning and querying.
The scope is limited to core academic entities: 
*Persons: Students and Teachers.  
*Courses: Academic subjects and their prerequisite hierarchies. 
*Departments: Academic affiliations. 
*Academic Terms: Semesters or terms. 

# Technical-Specifications
*Ontology Language: OWL 2 (Web Ontology Language) / RDF.
*Development Tool: Protégé.  
*Reasoning Support: Designed for reasoners like HermiT or Pellet.

# Ontology-Structure
Core Classes
*person: The base class for individuals.  
*student: Individuals enrolled in courses. 
*professors: Individuals responsible for teaching. 
*course: Academic subjects. 
*department: University departments.  
*academicTerm: Specific periods of study.

# Object-Properties
*belongsTo: Connects a person to a department.  
*hasPrerequisite: Defines prerequisite relationships between courses (Transitive property).  
*isEnrolledIn: Connects a student to a course.  
*teaches: Connects a professor to a course.

# Competency-Questions (CQs)
The system is designed to answer the following questions: 
1- What are the prerequisite courses for a specific Course?  
2- Which Department does a specific Student belong to?   
3- Is a specific Student enrolled in a specific Course? 
4- Which Courses are taught by a specific Teacher?

# Example-Instances (Individuals)
The ontology includes several initial instances for testing: 
*Students: Ayca Keskin, Efe Sarıgül, Sinem, and Özgür. 
*Professors: Can, Gamze, and Nihat.  
*Courses: Automata Theory, Physics, Knowledge Engineering and Ontologies, Operating Systems, and Mathematics. 

# Usage
You can open the university-knowledge-graph.rdf file using Protégé to explore the classes, properties, and individuals, or to run SPARQL queries for data analysis.
